      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
      I am an Indiana native and grew up in the city of Fishers. I began attending Ball
      State University in Muncie, Indiana starting August 2017. In May 2021, I graduated 
      <em>summa cum laude</em> from Ball State with a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
      During my time as a student there, I was a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society 
      and served as chapter president during the 2020-21 school year. I also served as a teaching 
      assistant for classes teaching Java, Python, discrete mathematics, and distributed systems/networking. 
      Though computers have been my passion for some time, I was about halfway through my years at 
      Ball State when I discovered how much I enjoy cybersecurity. I have since been working 
      diligently to learn essential skills for the subject.

      I will be pursuing my master's degree in computer science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, 
      Indiana starting August 2021. I will also be joining a research team led by Dr. Dongyan Xu and Dr. Ananth 
      Grama, where we will work to strengthen cybersecurity practices in industrial control systems.
      Outside of technology, I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, horror (Stephen King all the way!), 
      and science in general. I also enjoy spending time with my girlfriend Gina, my friends, and my family.
