    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
      <p>
      I am an Indiana native and grew up in the city of Fishers. I began attending Ball
      State University in Muncie, Indiana starting August 2017. In May 2021, I graduated 
      <em>summa cum laude</em> from Ball State with a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
      During my time as a student there, I was a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society 
      and served as chapter president during the 2020-21 school year. I also served as a teaching 
      assistant for classes teaching Java, Python, discrete mathematics, and distributed systems/networking. 
      Though computers have been my passion for some time, I was about halfway through my years at 
      Ball State when I discovered how much I enjoy cybersecurity. I have since been working 
      diligently to learn essential skills for the subject.

      I will be pursuing my master's degree in computer science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, 
      Indiana starting August 2021. I am planning to research cybersecurity in industrial control systems 
      under the supervision of Dr. Dongyan Xu. Outside of technology, I enjoy reading about history, 
      philosophy, horror (Stephen King all the way!), and science in general. I also enjoy spending time 
      with my girlfriend Gina, my friends, and my family.
